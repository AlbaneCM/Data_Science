# Data_Science
Summary of topics learned on Codecademy through the Data Science career path. 
Projects are from the Codecademy's course.
They are chronologically ordered, so the highest number is the most recent and includes the most recent topics reviewed.  


1. Life Expectancy corresponds to:

    - violinplot
    - barplot including hue 
    - scatterplot 
    - lineplot


2. Biodiversity displays a summary of Python operations, including: 
- Modifying dataframes e.g.: 
  - Replacing N/A values in columns
  - Multiple dataframes: creating new one from existing ones
  - Merging dataframes 
- Calculating command statistics: nunique
- Calculating aggregate functions: groupby 
- Selecting columns & rows with logic: groupby, reset_index(), relational operators   
- Data Visualization: 
  - Matplotlib
- Hypothesis testing:
  - chi2_contingency 
 

3. MuscleHub project includes series of operations reviewed on SQL & Python, including:
SQL: 
- Selection of tables
- Limit of table's selection
- Selection of tables' columns: all and specific ones 
- Joining several tables under the same column 
- Filtering on one column's criterion (here, visit date) 
Python: 
- Modifying dataframes e.g.: 
  - creating new columns
  - performing column operations 
- Calculating command statistics
- Calculating aggregate functions: groupby
- Selecting columns & rows with logic: apply, lambda, groupby, reset_index(), relational operators
- Lambda function

4. Yelp Regression Project 
Machine Learning 
- Builds a linear regression model predicting a restaurant's Yelp rating
Processes include from Python:
- Importing data
- Inspecting data
- Calculating command statistics
- Selecting columns & rows with logic
- Merging data 
- Cleaning data 
- Modifying data 
- Exploratory analysis 
- Data visualization: Matplotlib
- Creating the Linear Regression Model 
- Evaluating the model 

5. Tic tac to 
Machine Learning 
- Building Tic tac toe game using minimax algorithm to make decision as to which of "X" or "O" to play 
- 5_a_tic_tac_toe is the first file to run, where the algorithm is defined
- 5_b_playing_game is the file allowing to play the game, either you against computer or computer against itself
